# Abstract from the project application
project_abstract: |
  Molecular dynamics is an exceptional simulation tool that connects fundamental physics
  with more applied research.
  It is the workhorse in our collaborations with experimental researchers
  to enrich their findings with computational predictions and insights.
  Such simulations rely on an interatomic force model,
  which is always a trade-off between computational efficiency, accuracy,
  and the ability to describe all relevant physics.
  Recently, we proposed the "electron Machine Learning Potential" (eMLP),
  which reconciles these requirements in an unparalleled way:
  it is not only fast and accurate,
  but also able to describe physical phenomena inaccessible to analoguous models,
  such as spectra (direct comparison with experiment),
  and charge transport (important for energy materials).
  Our goal is to elevate the eMLP from a promising prototype to a robust simulation tool,
  and to showcase its strengths with unrivaled simulations of solid electrolyte conductivity
  and Raman spectra.

university_storage: |
  - UGent Project Shares.
    This is a Windows-based platform without support for
    Unix file permissions, symbolic links, nor SSH access.
    Hence, it will only be used to for long-term storage of completed datasets,
    for which the burden of the occasional manual upload of data is acceptable.
  - On-premises SSH server.
    All researches with access to live data will exchange larger data sets
    through an SSH server managed by one of the PIs.

hpc: |
  - Resource-intensive calculations are carried out at the infrastructure of the
    #link("https://www.vscentrum.be/")[Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum (VSC)].
    Data is only kept on the HPC clusters for the duration of the calculations.


## 4. Data Collection

# List the types of the raw data sets that will be generated through experimental
# measurements or computer simulations.
# Mention the file formats and explain long-term usability.
# Also mention what role each data set will play in the project.
raw_data_what: |
  - Training data for the machine learning models in the project.
    (extended XYZ format)
  - Trained hybrid machine-learning and physical models to describe interactions
    at the atomic scale. (pytorch models)
  - Molecular dynamics simulations obtained using the models from the previous point.
    (CSV and XYZ trajectory formats)
  - Post-processing analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations
    to derive physical properties that can predict or corroborate experimental outcomes.
    (CSV, NPY, NPZ, and Zar formats)

# List additional source files in text-based formats that will be employed in the project.
# Emphasize standard formats that are widely adopted and can be created and processed with open-source tools.
source_text_how: |
  - Jinja2 templates for input files of simulation software
    (quantum chemistry, machine-learning and molecular dynamics).

## 7. Data Selection and Preservation after Research

# Describe for how long data are preserved.
# Mention requirements imposed by funding agencies.
data_lifetime: |
  Ghent University's RDM policy framework expects 'relevant' research data
  to be preserved for a minimum of 5 years.
  However, in our field, data remains valuable for longer periods of time.
  The data created in this project will be preserved for at least 10 years.
